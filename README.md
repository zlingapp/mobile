# zling Flutter

## NOTICE
I haven't worked on this and so it has likely fallen victim to breaking API changes :(. Instead of updating it, I'll probably rewrite it with Riverpod or Bloc at some point because this implementation was mostly me learning Flutter and as such sucks

---

A Flutter implementation of the zling frontend, intended for mobile use but could be extended to desktop or web pretty easily.
